## My Monthly Calendar
My Monthly Calendar is an Alexa skill that displays events from a linked Google account in a monthly view with days of the week along the top, and weeks going down, similar to how it's laid out in [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r/month).

When opened it will display your calendar allowing you to scroll, as much as Alexa allows depending on the number of events in your calendar. You can then ask it about various entries you have in your calendar, either via voice, or by tapping on an entry. You can also tap on a day and it will tell you what events you have then.

**Only works with devices with a rectangular display.**
